# Guest Session: Storybook

This project is a showcase of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

- Clone this repository via `git clone`.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Run Storybook via `npm run storybook`.

## Tour

You will find stories in two different locations:

- `/src/components`: Stories written during the lecture.
- `/src/stories`: These stories are the (slightly modified) default stories shipped from storybook during the installation.

## Note

Please note that the `main` branch is the starting point of the session. You can `git checkout` the branches to find the relevant solution(s).
